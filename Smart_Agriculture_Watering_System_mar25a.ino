  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

  int sm_sensor1;
  int sm_sensor2;
  bool esp32_relay1;
  bool esp32_relay2;
  bool esp32_waterpump;

  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.
